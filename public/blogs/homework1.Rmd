# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

Two types of variables: Character & Numeric.
0 missing values. 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
glimpse(drinks)
skimr::skim(drinks)

```


Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
drinks %>%
  slice_max(order_by=beer_servings, n=25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=beer_servings, y=fct_reorder(country, beer_servings))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "TOP 25 BEER CONSUMING COUNTRIES ",
    x = "Servings",
    y = "Country"
  )
```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

drinks %>%
  slice_max(order_by=wine_servings, n=25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wine_servings, y=fct_reorder(country, wine_servings))) +
  geom_col() +
   labs(
    title = "TOP 25 WINE CONSUMING COUNTRIES ",
    x = "Servings",
    y = "Country"
  )

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
drinks %>%
  slice_max(order_by=spirit_servings, n=25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=spirit_servings, y=fct_reorder(country, spirit_servings))) +
  geom_col() +
   labs(
    title = "TOP 25 SPIRIT CONSUMING COUNTRIES ",
    x = "Servings",
    y = "Country"
  )

```

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
skimr::skim(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?

No missing values.
54 duplicate titles.

- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order

```{r, count_of_movies_by_genre}
unique_movies <- movies %>% 
  distinct(title,genre, director, year,.keep_all=TRUE)

count_movies_genre<- unique_movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>%
  count(sort=TRUE) 

head(count_movies_genre)
```

- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre.
Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order

```{r, gross_budget}
return_on_budget_movies <- unique_movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(mean_gross= mean(gross), mean_budget= mean(budget)) %>%
  mutate(return_on_budget= (mean_gross-mean_budget)/mean_budget) %>%
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))

head(return_on_budget_movies)
```
- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

```{r, top15directors}
top_15_directors <- unique_movies %>% 
  select(director, gross) %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(sum_gross = sum(gross), mean_gross= mean(gross), median_gross= median(gross), std_gross= sd(gross)) %>% 
  top_n(15, sum_gross) %>% 
  arrange(-sum_gross)
  

head(top_15_directors)

```
- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 

```{r, ratings}
ratings_movies<- unique_movies %>% 
  select(genre, rating) %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(mean_rating= mean(rating), min_rating=min(rating), max_rating= max(rating), median_rating=median(rating), std_rating= sd(rating)) 

head(ratings_movies)

unique_movies %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=rating)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(vars(genre))
```

## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. 
  
Number of facebook likes that the cast has received is not a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. There are cases where a movie earned a high revenue with zero likes.

```{r,gross_on_cast_facebook_likes}
unique_movies %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y=gross)) +
  geom_point() 

```

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

Yes, budget is a good predictor of how much revenue will the movie make. There is a positive relationship between the two as we can see from the graph.

```{r, gross_on_budget}
unique_movies %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=budget, y=gross)) +
  geom_point() 

```
  
  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

Especially in Action, Adventure and Comedy movies higher the rating so is the revenue. However, this is not true for all genres. For example, we do not have enough data to decide on the effect of rating on the revenue for genres like Family, Romance, and Musical. Additionally, strange thing in this data set is that change in rating does not explain much the change in revenue for Horror and Crime movies. 

```{r, gross_on_rating}
unique_movies %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=rating, y=gross)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(genre))

```


# Returns of financial stocks


> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/). 

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns. 

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO  (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}
comp_per_sector <- nyse %>% 
  group_by(sector) %>% 
  summarise(count= count(sector)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

head(comp_per_sector)

ggplot(comp_per_sector, aes(x=count, y= fct_reorder(sector,count))) +
  geom_col()
```


Next, let's choose the [Dow Jones Industrial Aveareg (DJIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Besides the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add `SPY` which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The following code 


```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}

djia_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"


#get tables that exist on URL
tables <- djia_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
djia <- map(tables, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())


# constituents
table1 <- djia[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the ticker symbols
  mutate(date_added = ymd(date_added),
         
         # if a stock is listed on NYSE, its symbol is, e.g., NYSE: MMM
         # We will get prices from yahoo finance which requires just the ticker
         
         # if symbol contains "NYSE*", the * being a wildcard
         # then we jsut drop the first 6 characters in that string
         ticker = ifelse(str_detect(symbol, "NYSE*"),
                          str_sub(symbol,7,11),
                          symbol)
         )

# we need a vector of strings with just the 30 tickers + SPY
tickers <- table1 %>% 
  select(ticker) %>% 
  pull() %>% # pull() gets them as a sting of characters
  c("SPY") # and lets us add SPY, the SP500 ETF

```

Now let us downlaod prices for all 30 DJIA consituents and the SPY ETF that tracks SP500 since January 1, 2020

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2000-01-01",
         to   = Sys.Date()) %>% # Sys.Date() returns today's price
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}
summr_monthly_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise(min= min(monthly_returns), max=max(monthly_returns), median=median(monthly_returns), mean=mean(monthly_returns), std=sd(monthly_returns))

head(summr_monthly_returns)
```

Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}

myStocks_returns_monthly %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x=symbol)) +
  geom_density()

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
library(ggrepel)
summr_monthly_returns %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=std, y=mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=symbol))

```

# Is inflation transitory?


> You may find useful the material on [downloading economic data from the FRED](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/#data-from-the-federal-reserve-economic-data-with-tidyquant). 

A recent study by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claimed that the [Current Inflation Spike Is Just Transitory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/current-inflation-spike-is-just-transitory-new-bis-study-argues). As the article says, 


> The surge in inflation seen across major economies is probably short lived because it’s confined to just a few sectors of the economy, according to the Bank for International Settlements. 

> New research by the BIS’s Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, Egon Zakrajsek and Dora Xia adds to one of the hottest debates in economics -- how long the current surge in consumer prices will last. Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his euro-area counterpart Christine Lagarde have said the pickup is probably transitory, despite a snarled global supply chain and a spike in energy prices. 

You have to download data for CPI and the 10 year bill and produce the following graph


```{r cpi_10year, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cpi_10year.png"), error = FALSE)
```


The relevant indicators from FRED are:

- [Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)
- [10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GS10)


```{r, get_cpi_10Year_yield}

cpi  <-   tq_get("CPIAUCSL", get = "economic.data",
                       from = "1980-01-01") %>% 
  rename(cpi = symbol,  # FRED data is given as 'symbol' and 'price'
         rate = price) %>% # we rename them to what they really are, e.g., cpi and rate
  
  # calculate yearly change in CPI by dividing current month by same month a year (or 12 months) earlier, minus 1
  mutate(cpi_yoy_change = rate/lag(rate, 12) - 1)

ten_year_monthly  <-   tq_get("GS10", get = "economic.data",
                       from = "1980-01-01") %>% 
  rename(ten_year = symbol,
         yield = price) %>% 
  mutate(yield = yield / 100) # original data is not given as, e.g., 0.05, but rather 5, for five percent

# we have the two dataframes-- we now need to join them, and we will use left_join()
# base R has a function merge() that does the same, but it's slow, so please don't use it

mydata <- 
  cpi %>% 
  left_join(ten_year_monthly, by="date") %>% 
  mutate(
    year = year(date), # using lubridate::year() to generate a new column with just the year
    month = month(date, label = TRUE),
    decade=case_when(
