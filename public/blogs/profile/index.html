<div id="about-me" class="section level1">
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p>I grew up in Singapore, and moved over to London for my undergraduate studies at LSE. I obtained a BSc in Economics, and decided to take on a specialised Master’s degree in finance to develop my knowledge of various financial topics.</p>
<p><em>Education and Career Aspirations</em></p>
<p>During my time at LSE, I was elected as the co-chairman of the Asia Investment and Banking Conference, one of the largest student-run conference introducing finance to university students. Its website can be found <a href="https://www.aibc.asia/" class="uri">https://www.aibc.asia/</a> .This experience inspired me to pursue a long-term career in finance, and I subsequently completed internships in London and Singapore. My experiences span across different industries - including tech, real estate, and industrials. My favourite aspect of finance is that I get the opportunity to learn about different business models across various industries at a fast-pace.</p>
<p>Now at LBS, I am excited to see that there is so much support to help me achieve my career aspirations. Beyond the practical curriculum at LBS, I am also supported by a group of internationally diverse classmates who are always willing to help me learn and develop myself. Furthermore, the school’s strong career support and wide alumni network have also supported me immensely. I am excited to build up my professional network at such an early stage of my career, and LBS has proved to be the perfect place for me to do so.</p>
<p><em>Hobbies</em></p>
<p>An interesting fact about myself is that I am a certified life-guard. On a personal note, I also enjoy water sports immensely. I started swimming competitively since the age of 5, and have participated in nearly 20 national competitions in Singapore. I also sail the Optimist boat as a hobby.</p>
