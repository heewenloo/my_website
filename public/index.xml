      <description>Returns of financial stocks Next, let’s choose the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Besides the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add SPY which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).
We will use the rvest package to scrape the Wikipedia page for the constituents of DJIA
djia_url &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average&amp;quot; #get tables that exist on URL tables &amp;lt;- djia_url %&amp;gt;% read_html() %&amp;gt;% html_nodes(css=&amp;quot;table&amp;quot;) # parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia.</description>
